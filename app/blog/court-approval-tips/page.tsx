              <ol className="mb-4">
                <li className="mb-3"><strong>Gather All Required Documents:</strong> Bring your settlement agreement, payment schedule, government-issued ID, and the sale agreement. Missing paperwork is a common reason for delays.</li>
                <li className="mb-3"><strong>Prepare a Clear Statement of Need:</strong> Judges want to know why you are selling your payments. Be honest and specific about your financial goals (e.g., paying off debt, medical bills, education, home purchase).</li>
                <li className="mb-3"><strong>Understand the Terms:</strong> Be ready to explain the sale terms, including the lump sum you'll receive, the discount rate, and any fees. Demonstrating understanding shows you are making an informed decision.</li>
                <li className="mb-3"><strong>Consult an Advisor:</strong> Some states require an independent professional advisor. Even if not required, consulting a financial advisor or attorney can help you prepare and answer questions confidently.</li>
                <li className="mb-3"><strong>Be Honest and Transparent:</strong> Answer all questions truthfully. Judges appreciate candor and may deny approval if they sense uncertainty or incomplete information.</li>
                <li className="mb-3"><strong>Review State-Specific Requirements:</strong> Each state has unique laws and forms. Check your state's requirements in our <Link href="/structured-settlement-info-hub/state-laws">State Laws Guide</Link>.</li>
                <li className="mb-3"><strong>Arrive Early and Dress Appropriately:</strong> Treat the hearing like any important legal proceeding. Arriving early and dressing professionally shows respect for the process.</li>
