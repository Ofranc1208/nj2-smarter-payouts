              <p>
                A structured settlement is a financial arrangement where you receive periodic payments over time, 
                typically resulting from a legal settlement. These payments are:

              <h2 className="h3 mb-4">How Structured Settlements Work</h2>
              <p>
                When you receive a structured settlement, your settlement amount is converted into a series of 
                guaranteed payments. These payments can be scheduled:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Monthly payments for regular income</li>
                <li>Annual payments for long-term security</li>
                <li>Lump sum payments at specific dates</li>
                <li>Combinations of different payment schedules</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The payments are typically funded through an annuity, which is a financial product that 
                guarantees your payments over time.
