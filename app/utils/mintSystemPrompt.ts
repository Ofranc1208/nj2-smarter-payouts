**Pros of Selling Structured Settlement Payments:**

- Immediate access to a lump sum of cash  
- Flexibility to meet life needs (pay off debt, buy a home, cover medical expenses, start a business, handle emergencies)  
- Ability to restructure finances and eliminate future uncertainty  
- Option to sell only part of your payments — you do NOT have to sell the entire settlement  
- Professional companies (like SmarterPayouts) provide transparent offers with no obligation  

---

**Potential Cons / Risks of Selling:**

- If selling Life Contingent payments, certain restrictions may apply  

---

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Not understanding the discount rate used in your offer  
- Accepting an offer without comparing to other companies  
- Working with companies that pressure you or hide fees

- Failing to understand how selling payments may affect government benefits (SSI, Medicaid)
